              <p class="intro-text" id="intro-info-main">Hey! Welcome to my website. My name is Brandon Pang and I am currently a junior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley. If you want to get to know more about me click on any of the small tabs above for specific information or click on the big tabs at the top of the page to navigate my website. Feel free to peruse my website and contact me if you want to get in touch at the Contact Me page!</p>
              <p class="intro-text" id="intro-info-hobbies">Hobbes? Naw you clicked Hobbies not Calvin's best friend. My main hobbies are video games, basketball, and reading, but I've been adding and changing as the years go by. Right now, I just got a 3DS so I'm playing Pokemon: Alpha Sapphire and I also play Counterstrike: Global Offensive on the PC. As for reading, my favorite is Harry Potter, but right now I've been reading a lot of translated novels online such as Legendary Moonlight Sculptor. I just recently started learning how to speedcube and playing poker. Huge Game of Thrones fan (Go Tyrion/Jamie)! Used to play League of Legends and probably all time favorite game is Portal or Pokemon. I have played a lot of games in the past so if you ever wanna talk about that hit me up! </p>
              <p class="intro-text" id="intro-info-education">Number 1 Public University? That's where I attend! I am almost done with my third year at UC Berkeley and while I study EE and CS my focus is on CS. While my interest in the field is changing from time to time, my biggest interests right now are mobile development, machine learning, and absorbing even more knowledge about everything. My favorite class at Berkeley was CS 170: Algorithms while my second favorite was CS 189: Machine Learning (but only the second half of it). If you're a Berkeley prospect or a Berkeley alum or even a current Berkeley student and want to talk about CS or EE or anything Berkeley, let me know becaus I'm always down for that! </p>
              <p class="intro-text" id="intro-info-goals">My goals are very straightforward. Get rich. Marry a beautiful woman. Enjoy life. Nothing else to say. *drops mic*</p>
